# Introduction

Artoria is a Java technology framework based on the Facade pattern. Its design philosophy is to provide users with a unified interface for interaction with other modules through the Facade pattern. Users do not need to understand the implementation details of other modules, and they will not be coupled with a specific implementation, which is more conducive to extension and maintenance.
